# Changelog

## v0.3.0-beta.2

**Beta pre-release.**

### Added

Nine new sensors, sourced from two previously unused OBI API endpoints and
three fields already present in the `/bridges` response but not yet exposed:

- `sensor.obi_forecast_weekly` / `sensor.obi_forecast_monthly` — consumption
  forecast in Wh from `GET /analytics/{hh_id}/{mid_id}/forecast`.
- `sensor.obi_standby_daily` / `_weekly` / `_monthly` / `_yearly` — standby
  (baseline) consumption in Wh for the last completed period, from
  `GET /analytics/{hh_id}/{mid_id}/{interval}/standby`. Only report a value
  once a full period has elapsed; a freshly set up bridge will show `weekly`,
  `monthly`, and `yearly` as unavailable until enough time has passed.
- `sensor.obi_ota_status` / `sensor.obi_ota_progress` /
  `sensor.obi_upload_interval` — the bridge sensor's `otaStatus`,
  `otaProgress`, and `uploadInterval` fields, already fetched as part of
  every `/bridges` poll but previously discarded.

The standby query always requests a fixed 35-day window regardless of the
configured `historical_duration`, to reliably cover the last completed month
independent of that (often much shorter) setting.

## v0.3.0-beta.1

**Beta pre-release** — published so it can be installed via HACS by enabling
"Show beta versions" for this repository, without affecting users on the
regular v0.2.1 release. Please try it out and report any issues in the
GitHub issues before it's promoted to a regular release.

Adds `switch.obi_live_tracking` (fixes #19) to turn live tracking on/off at
runtime — from an automation, script, or the dashboard — without reloading
the integration. The **Enable live tracking** option now only controls the
state live tracking starts in after a Home Assistant restart; the switch is
what you'd wire up to e.g. disable live tracking during off-peak hours to
save the sensor's battery, and re-enable it later.

## v0.2.1

Raises the default `scan_interval` from 60 to 300 seconds.

OBI's product team confirmed directly that their backend only writes new
readings into its own timeseries database every 5 minutes, regardless of how
often it's polled. Polling more frequently than that doesn't get you fresher
data — it just repeats the same reading and adds unnecessary load on OBI's
servers. Users who already set a custom `scan_interval` are unaffected; this
only changes the out-of-the-box default for new setups.

## v0.2.0

Adds optional live tracking (PR #13, contributed by @la-sina), plus a fix for
stale `energy`/`negative_energy` readings that affects everyone.

### Added

- **Live tracking** (disabled by default, enable via the integration's
  **Configure** options): opens a WebSocket connection to OBI's live-mode
  endpoint and requests a fast (2-second) sensor upload interval, exposing
  four new diagnostic entities — `sensor.obi_live_power`,
  `sensor.obi_live_rssi`, `sensor.obi_live_battery`, and
  `sensor.obi_live_last_message`. `sensor.obi_live_power` reports raw watts as
  sent by OBI; the sign convention for consumption vs. feed-in is not yet
  confirmed. Turning live tracking off (or unloading/reloading the
  integration) restores the sensor's normal 300-second upload interval so the
  physical device doesn't stay in fast-report mode.

### Fixed

- Historical polling for `energy`/`negative_energy` no longer stalls while
  live tracking is active — the live-data listener previously nudged the
  coordinator's regular refresh timer on every live message, which could
  starve the normal historical-data poll when live updates arrived every
  couple of seconds.
- `_latest_measurement` now also recognizes a `time` field (in addition to
  `timestamp`) on historical records, matching a response variant observed
  from OBI's API.

## v0.1.2

Reduces the default `historical_duration` from `PT6H` to `PT15M`.

Community testing (see the OBI Energy Tracker thread on photovoltaikforum.de)
found that a large historical-data window like `PT6H` can make OBI's API
return older data instead of the latest reading, even with the v0.1.1 fix
applied — the symptom looks identical to issue #10 but is caused by the
window size itself, not the request format. Users who already changed
`historical_duration` in the options manually are unaffected; this only
changes the out-of-the-box default for new setups. The options description
now also documents this tradeoff directly in the UI.

## v0.1.1

Fixes #10 (energy/negative_energy measurements stop updating even though
the OBI app shows fresh readings):

- `/historical-data` now sends a single ISO 8601 `<start>/<duration>`
  interval as one `duration` parameter, instead of separate `end=`/
  `duration=` query parameters - matching the request shape confirmed to
  work in another OBI HACS integration. The previous two-parameter form
  may not have been parsed correctly by OBI's backend.
- Added `Cache-Control: no-cache` / `Pragma: no-cache` headers on every
  authenticated request, in case CloudFront (which fronts OBI's API) was
  serving a stale cached response.
- Added debug-level logging of each historical-data poll (record count,
  latest energy/negative_energy timestamp and value) to help diagnose any
  remaining staleness directly from the Home Assistant log.

## v0.1.0

Initial working release:
- UI config flow
- OBI login with country=de
- JWT kept only in memory
- bridge discovery
- energy and feed-in sensors
- kWh sensors compatible with HA Energy Dashboard
- diagnostics sensors
- automatic token refresh / 401 retry
- debug logging without token/password leakage

### Details

First tagged release. The integration is fully config-flow based (no YAML),
logs into the OBI/heyOBI Energy Tracking API, discovers the bridge/sensor,
and exposes native Home Assistant entities for consumption, feed-in, battery,
connectivity and diagnostics.

#### Added

- Config flow: email/password entry, automatic bridge/sensor discovery with
  a picker for multiple bridges, and a manual `HH_ID`/`MID_ID` fallback when
  `/bridges` is unavailable.
- Reauth flow (triggered automatically on authentication failure) and a
  reconfigure flow to update credentials later.
- Options flow: measurement scan interval, login refresh interval,
  historical data duration, debug logging toggle, and manual `HH_ID`/`MID_ID`
  overrides.
- `DataUpdateCoordinator`-based polling with sensors for:
  `sensor.obi_energy`, `sensor.obi_energy_kwh`, `sensor.obi_negative_energy`,
  `sensor.obi_einspeisung_kwh`, `sensor.obi_netto_energy_kwh`,
  `sensor.obi_bridge_battery`, `sensor.obi_bridge_connection_strength`,
  `sensor.obi_last_record_received`, and `binary_sensor.obi_bridge_online`.
- Diagnostics support (redacts email/password; the session token is never
  persisted, logged, or exposed anywhere).
- German and English translations for the config flow, options flow, and
  entity names.
- `hacs.json` for HACS custom-repository installation.

#### Fixed

- Login now sends the exact request shape confirmed via a mitmproxy capture
  of the real heyOBI app: a compact JSON body (`{"password", "country":
  "de", "email"}`, no whitespace) sent as raw bytes via `data=` with an
  explicit `Content-Length`, plus the `Host`/`Origin`/`Referer`/`Cookie`
  headers the app sends. Earlier attempts using aiohttp's `json=` shortcut
  were rejected by CloudFront in front of OBI's login endpoint.
- Entities become `unavailable` (instead of reporting `0`) when login fails,
  `/bridges` can't be retrieved, or historical data is empty/invalid, so
  Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard statistics never see a false reading.
- Config flow and API client now log the real failure reason (DNS, SSL,
  timeout, HTTP status with response headers/truncated body, JSON decode
  errors) instead of a generic "cannot connect", without ever logging
  tokens, passwords, or full request bodies.
- Device info is consistent across all entities (`manufacturer: "OBI"`,
  `model: "heyOBI Energy Tracking"`, device name `"OBI Energy Bridge"`), and
  entity names use `translation_key` so they render correctly per language.
  Each entity's `entity_id` is pinned via `suggested_object_id` (e.g.
  `sensor.obi_energy`) so it stays short and stable regardless of the
  translated display name.
